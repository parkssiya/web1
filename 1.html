  <h2><a href="https://genius.com/Adele-someone-like-you-lyrics" target="_blank" title="lyrics">
    Someone like you 가사</a></h2>

  <p>I heard that you're settled down
  That you found a girl and you're married now
  I heard that your dreams came true
  Guess she gave you things, I didn't give to you</p>
  <p>Old friend, why are you so shy?
  Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
  I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
  But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
  I had hoped you'd see my face
  And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over</p>
  <p style="margin-top:40px;">Never mind, I'll find <strong><u>someone</u> like you</strong>
  I wish nothing but the best for you, too
  "Don't forget me, " I beg
  "I'll remember, " you said
  Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
